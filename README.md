### MyFight Fare Prediction: Predicting Flight Fares

**Introduction:**
Welcome to MyFight Fare Prediction repository, where I present my personal project on predicting flight fares. In this project, I've explored various aspects of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning to build a model that predicts flight fares with high accuracy.

### Data Preprocessing and EDA

**Data Cleaning:**
Before diving into analysis, I meticulously cleaned the dataset, addressing missing data, and removing outliers. This ensured the integrity and reliability of the subsequent analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis:**
I employed a range of EDA techniques, including data visualization, statistical analysis, and feature engineering. Through this process, I gained insights into the relationships between different variables and their impact on flight fares.

**Machine Learning Model Selection:**
Using supervised machine learning techniques, I evaluated several algorithms to determine the most effective model for predicting flight fares. After rigorous testing, I concluded that the Random Forest algorithm consistently outperformed others, achieving an impressive prediction accuracy of 99.12%.

### Final Prediction and Deployment

**Final Prediction:**
With the Random Forest model identified as the optimal choice, I applied it to make final predictions of flight fares. Leveraging the model's accuracy, users can obtain reliable fare estimates for their desired flights, aiding in travel planning and budgeting.



### Conclusion

MyFight Fare Prediction project showcases the power of data-driven approaches in tackling real-world challenges. By combining thorough data preprocessing, insightful EDA techniques, and advanced machine learning algorithms, I've created a robust model capable of accurately predicting flight fares. With deployment on AWS, this solution is poised to provide valuable assistance to travelers worldwide.
